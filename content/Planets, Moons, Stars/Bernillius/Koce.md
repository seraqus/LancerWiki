## Overview
While the planet itself is 90% ocean there is one main continent on which all the inhabitants live. This continent while not much bigger than the Africa of old on Cradle is lush with life on the edges with a desert in the middle that consists mostly of salt flats.

## Inhabitants
- **Sentient Species:** Humans and other carbon based lifeforms that were cloned and recreated form Cradle.

## Natural Resources
- Water
- Salt
- Fish
- Silica
## Climate and Weather
The biggest issue this planet faces are the many tsunamis that hit the shores of the continent due to the sheer size of the ocean and the tectonic activity. Rains are plentiful and hurricanes are a rare sight but can still occur under the right conditions.
## History
Originally colonized for it's likeness to Cradle, this planet has been terraformed and most of it's original species hunted to extinction thousands of years ago in order to bring a sense of home to the humas that arrived. It was then used to harvest fish as a primary food source for the rest of this system and to process for oil.

- Massive salt flats
## Exploration Opportunities
The vast ocean is mostly unexplored but it is highly advised not to stray too far from the shores as it is to court death itself. No one has ever come back from such a trip and it is believed that there are quite a few monsters that lurk in the deep.
## Notes
This planet is not involved in any political conflicts at this time mostly due in part tot he protection of Shrike Tactical Security.
