**Team Members:**

**Summary:** [[The Lance]] arrived on site where they were met not by pirates but instead by the House of Iron at one of their outposts.

**Intel Gathered:** [[The Lance]] was setup by [[Shrike Tactical Security]] to take a tablet from the [[House of Iron]] outpost on [[Koce]]. 

**Tactical Analysis:** The team did a great job of managing target enmity even when one pilot was being focus fired in particular. They also made great use of terrain and equipment to control the enemy forces.

**Mechanical Evaluation:** All mechs were destroyed when the [[Lich]] detonated its para-causality core.

**Casualty Report:** All pilots were KIA when the [[Lich]] detonated its para-causality core but where able to be cloned on [[Helios]] after having uploaded their DNA to the [[House of Iron]] network.

**Recommendations:** Outfit new replacement Mechs now that [[The Lance]] has access to better printing facilities and their old ones destroyed.

**After-Action Review:** 

**Conclusion:** This was a suicide mission and [[The Lance]] was lucky to have talked there way out of it and side with some new allies to one day strike back at [[Shrike Tactical Security]] and [[Cooper Graven, Jackal]] for their betrayal.
